# Open Source Data Structures, Algorithms, and Practice Problems Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the Open Source Data Structures, Algorithms, and Practice Problems repository! This repository is a collaborative effort to provide a comprehensive collection of data structures, algorithms, and practice problems implemented in various programming languages.

### Features

1. Data Structures: Discover a wide range of commonly used data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, heaps, and more. Each data structure is implemented with clear explanations and proper documentation.

2. Algorithms: Explore a variety of fundamental algorithms including sorting, searching, graph traversal, dynamic programming, backtracking, and more. Each algorithm is carefully implemented and accompanied by explanations, time complexity analysis, and example use cases.

3. Practice Problems: Sharpen your problem-solving skills with a vast collection of practice problems covering different difficulty levels. These problems are designed to help you practice implementing algorithms and data structures in real-world scenarios. Each problem comes with a description, sample inputs and outputs, and possible solutions.

4. Multiple Programming Languages: This repository supports multiple programming languages, allowing you to explore and contribute in your preferred language. Currently, the repository includes implementations in languages such as C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, and more. Contributions in additional languages are always welcome!

5. Well-Organized Structure: The repository is organized into directories based on data structures, algorithms, and practice problems. Each directory contains relevant code files, detailed explanations, and additional resources, making it easy to navigate and find what you need.
