# Stack Data Structure

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It represents a collection of elements with two main operations: push and pop. The push operation adds an element to the top of the stack, and the pop operation removes the topmost element from the stack.

## Types of Stacks

1. **Array-based Stack**: This type of stack is implemented using an array. It has a fixed size, and the elements are stored contiguously in memory. The array-based stack allows random access to elements and is efficient in terms of accessing elements by index. However, its size is fixed and can lead to memory wastage if the stack exceeds the predefined limit.

2. **Linked List-based Stack**: This type of stack is implemented using a linked list. Each element in the stack is represented by a node, which contains the data and a reference to the next node. The linked list-based stack does not have a fixed size and can dynamically grow or shrink as elements are pushed or popped. It requires additional memory for storing the node references but can handle a variable number of elements efficiently.

## Complexity of Stack Operations

The complexity of stack operations depends on the implementation.

- **Access (Peek)**: The access operation retrieves the topmost element from the stack without removing it. Both array-based and linked list-based stacks have constant time complexity for accessing the top element, i.e., O(1).

- **Insert (Push)**: The insert operation adds an element to the top of the stack. In an array-based stack, the push operation has an amortized time complexity of O(1) since appending an element to the end of the array is typically a constant time operation. In a linked list-based stack, the push operation also has a constant time complexity of O(1) since it involves updating the reference of the new node to the previous top element.

- **Remove (Pop)**: The remove operation removes the topmost element from the stack. Both array-based and linked list-based stacks have constant time complexity for the pop operation, i.e., O(1). It involves updating the top index or the reference to the next node.

- **Find**: The find operation involves searching for a specific element within the stack. In a stack, finding an element typically requires iterating over the elements from the top until the element is found or the end of the stack is reached. The worst-case time complexity for finding an element in a stack is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the stack.

It's important to note that stack operations have constant time complexity (O(1)) in most cases, except for finding an element, which has a linear time complexity (O(n)).
