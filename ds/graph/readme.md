## Graph Data Structure

A graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of a set of vertices (also called nodes or points) and a set of edges (also called arcs or lines) that connect the vertices. It is a powerful and flexible data structure that can represent relationships between objects.

### Types of Graphs

1. **Undirected Graph**: In an undirected graph, the edges do not have a specific direction. The connection between vertices is symmetric, meaning that if there is an edge from vertex A to vertex B, there is also an edge from vertex B to vertex A.

2. **Directed Graph (Digraph)**: In a directed graph, the edges have a specific direction. The connection between vertices is asymmetric, meaning that if there is an edge from vertex A to vertex B, there may not be an edge from vertex B to vertex A.

3. **Weighted Graph**: In a weighted graph, each edge has a weight or cost associated with it. These weights can represent various metrics such as distance, cost, or time. Weighted graphs are commonly used in applications where the edges represent real-world quantities.

4. **Unweighted Graph**: In an unweighted graph, all edges have the same weight or no weight at all. The presence or absence of an edge indicates a connection between vertices without any additional information.

5. **Cyclic Graph**: A cyclic graph contains at least one cycle, which is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex. In a cyclic graph, it is possible to traverse a series of edges and return to the starting vertex.

6. **Acyclic Graph**: An acyclic graph does not contain any cycles. All paths in an acyclic graph are non-repetitive.

### Complexity of Graph Operations

The complexity of graph operations depends on the specific algorithm or traversal technique used. Here are the complexities for some common operations:

- **Accessing a Vertex or Edge**: O(1) - Accessing a vertex or an edge directly by its identifier or reference can be done in constant time.

- **Inserting a Vertex**: O(1) - Inserting a new vertex into a graph typically requires adding it to the existing set of vertices, which can be done in constant time.

- **Inserting an Edge**: O(1) - Inserting an edge between two vertices involves updating the adjacency list or matrix to include the new connection, which can be done in constant time.

- **Removing a Vertex**: O(|V| + |E|) - Removing a vertex from a graph requires removing all incident edges and updating the adjacency list or matrix accordingly. This process involves iterating over the vertices and edges connected to the removed vertex.

- **Removing an Edge**: O(1) - Removing an edge between two vertices involves updating the adjacency list or matrix to remove the connection, which can be done in constant time.

- **Finding Neighbors of a Vertex**: O(1) - Finding the neighbors of a vertex in an adjacency list representation can be done in constant time, as the neighbors are stored directly in the list.

- **Traversing the Graph**: The complexity of graph traversal algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) depends on the number of vertices and edges in the graph. For a graph with |V| vertices and |E| edges:
  - DFS: O(|V| + |E|) - The complexity of DFS is proportional to the sum of the number of vertices and edges in the graph.
  - BFS: O(|V| + |E|) - The complexity of BFS is also proportional to the sum of the number of vertices and edges in the graph.

It's important to note that these complexities represent the average or worst-case
