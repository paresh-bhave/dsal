# Tree Data Structure

A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. It is widely used to represent hierarchical relationships between elements. In a tree, each node can have zero or more child nodes, except for the root node, which has no parent.

## Types of Trees

There are several types of trees based on their characteristics and properties:

1. **Binary Tree**: In a binary tree, each node has at most two child nodes, referred to as the left child and the right child.

2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary search tree is a binary tree where the value of each node in the left subtree is less than or equal to the node's value, and the value of each node in the right subtree is greater than the node's value. This property enables efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

3. **AVL Tree**: An AVL (Adelson-Velskii and Landis) tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. It maintains a balance factor for each node, ensuring that the heights of the left and right subtrees differ by at most one. This balancing property guarantees efficient search, insert, and delete operations with a time complexity of O(log n).

4. **Red-Black Tree**: A red-black tree is another self-balancing binary search tree. It guarantees that the longest path from the root to any leaf is no more than twice as long as the shortest path. This balancing property ensures that the tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions, resulting in a time complexity of O(log n) for search, insert, and delete operations.

5. **B-Tree**: A B-tree is a self-balancing search tree that can have multiple keys and children per node. It is commonly used in file systems and databases, as it provides efficient disk access and supports large datasets. B-trees maintain a balance by ensuring that all leaf nodes are at the same level.

6. **Trie**: A trie, also known as a prefix tree, is a tree-like data structure used for efficient retrieval of keys that share prefixes. It is commonly used for implementing dictionaries and autocomplete features. Each node in the trie represents a character, and the path from the root to a node forms a key.

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of tree operations depends on the type of tree and the number of elements `n` in the tree.

- **Insert**: The time complexity for inserting a node into a tree depends on the type of tree and its balancing properties. In a binary search tree, the average time complexity for insertion is O(log n), while in a self-balancing tree like AVL or red-black tree, it remains O(log n) even in the worst case.

- **Access**: Accessing a specific node in a tree typically requires traversing from the root to the desired node. The time complexity for accessing a node in a tree is O(log n) for balanced trees like AVL, red-black, and B-trees, while it can be O(n) in the worst case for unbalanced binary trees.

- **Delete**: The time complexity for deleting a node from a tree depends on the type of tree and its balancing properties. In a binary search tree, the average time complexity for deletion is O(log n), while in a self-balancing tree like AVL or red-black tree, it remains O(log n) even in the worst case.

- **Traversal**: Traversing all nodes in a tree requires visiting each node once. The time complexity for traversal is O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.

## Applications

Trees are widely used in various domains and applications, including:

- File systems: Trees are used to represent directory structures, with each node representing
