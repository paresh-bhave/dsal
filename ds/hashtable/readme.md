# HashTable Data Structure

A HashTable, also known as a hash map, is a data structure that provides efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations. It stores data in an array-like structure and uses a hash function to map keys to indices in the array. This allows for constant-time access to elements based on their keys, making it an efficient choice for storing and retrieving data.

## Types of HashTables

1. **Separate Chaining HashTable**: In this type of HashTable, each index of the underlying array stores a linked list or another data structure to handle collisions. When multiple keys hash to the same index, they are stored in separate chains within the array. This type of HashTable handles collisions by allowing multiple elements to exist at the same index.

2. **Open Addressing HashTable**: In this type of HashTable, collisions are handled by probing or searching for the next available slot in the array. If an index is already occupied, the HashTable probes the next available slot until it finds an empty slot to store the element. Common probing techniques include:

### Open Addressing Probing Techniques
Sure! Here's an explanation of each of these collision resolution techniques used in hash tables:

1. Linear Probing:
   - Linear probing is a collision resolution technique where, if a collision occurs while inserting an element into a hash table, the algorithm searches for the next available slot by incrementing the index linearly until an empty slot is found.
   - When searching for an element, if the desired element is not found at the expected index, the algorithm continues searching linearly until either the element is found or an empty slot is encountered.
   - In linear probing, the step size is usually 1, which means the algorithm checks the next slot consecutively.
   - The main advantage of linear probing is its simplicity and cache-friendly behavior, but it can suffer from clustering issues, where consecutive elements cluster together, leading to degraded performance.

2. Quadratic Probing:
   - Quadratic probing is another collision resolution technique that aims to address the clustering issues of linear probing.
   - Instead of incrementing the index linearly, quadratic probing uses a quadratic function to compute the next index in case of a collision.
   - The quadratic function typically has the form `(i^2 + i) / 2`, where `i` is the number of iterations.
   - Quadratic probing allows the algorithm to explore the hash table more evenly, reducing clustering and improving performance.
   - However, quadratic probing can suffer from secondary clustering, where elements that initially collide continue to collide with the same set of slots, leading to additional performance degradation.

3. Double Hashing:
   - Double hashing is a collision resolution technique that involves using two hash functions to compute the step size for probing.
   - When a collision occurs, instead of incrementing the index linearly or using a quadratic function, double hashing calculates a new index using a secondary hash function.
   - The secondary hash function determines the step size, which is added to the current index to find the next available slot.
   - The goal of double hashing is to distribute the elements more evenly across the hash table, reducing clustering and improving performance.
   - Double hashing can provide better performance compared to linear probing and quadratic probing, but designing an effective secondary hash function is crucial for its success.

Each of these collision resolution techniques aims to handle collisions that occur when multiple elements map to the same index in the hash table. The choice of technique depends on various factors, including the specific use case, load factor, and desired performance characteristics.

## Complexity of HashTable Operations

The complexity of HashTable operations depends on several factors, including the number of elements in the table, the size of the underlying array, and the quality of the hash function used.

- **Access**: Accessing an element in a HashTable has an average time complexity of O(1). The hash function is used to compute the index of the element, and then direct access to the element is possible at that index. However, in the worst case, when there are many collisions and the HashTable has to linearly search through a long chain, the time complexity can be O(n), where n is the number of elements.

- **Insert**: Inserting an element into a HashTable also has an average time complexity of O(1). The hash function is used to compute the index, and the element is stored at that index. However, if there are collisions, additional time may be required to find the next available slot using probing techniques. In the worst case, when all elements hash to the same index, the time complexity can be O(n), where n is the number of elements.

- **Remove**: Removing an element from a HashTable has an average time complexity of O(1). The hash function is used to compute the index, and the element is removed from that index. If there are collisions and elements are stored in separate chains or probed, the time complexity may increase. In the worst case, when all elements hash to the same index, the time complexity can be O(n), where n is the number of elements.

- **Find**: Finding an element in a HashTable has an average time complexity of O(1). The hash function is used to compute the index, and the element is searched at that index. However, in the worst case, when there are many collisions and the HashTable has to linearly search through a long chain, the time complexity can be O(n), where n is the number of elements.

It's important to note that the performance of HashTable operations heavily depends on the quality of the hash function and the distribution of the keys. A good hash function minimizes collisions, resulting in efficient operations. Additionally, the load factor, which is the ratio of the number of elements to the size of the array, also affects the performance. Properly resizing the HashTable when the load factor exceeds a threshold can help maintain efficiency.
